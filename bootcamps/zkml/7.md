### ZKML

**Q: Can you talk about netron.app?**
**A:** Netron.app visualizes neural network architectures; supports ONNX, PyTorch, TensorFlow models for debugging and analysis.

**Q: Suggestions/tips for final week projects?**
**A:** Build ZKML-based apps (e.g., verifiable ML inference with EZKL), NFT authenticity proofs (ERC-7007), or cross-chain vaults (like Team 8). Use Foundry for testing; focus on gas optimization and security audits.

**Q: Is ERC-7007 an AI version of ERC-721?**
**A:** Yes, ERC-7007 extends ERC-721 for AI-generated NFTs, adding metadata for model parameters and generation proofs.

**Q: What’s the point of MPC if not splitting computation for speed?**
**A:** MPC ensures privacy by distributing computation across parties without revealing inputs, prioritizing security over speed.

**Q: How are shielded transactions done?**
**A:** Shielded txs (e.g., Zcash) use ZK-SNARKs to hide sender, receiver, and amount while proving validity via encrypted commitments.

**Q: What does LLVM stand for?**
**A:** Low-Level Virtual Machine; compiler infrastructure for code optimization and transformation.

**Q: Does Zcash use Halo2?**
**A:** No, Zcash uses Groth16 for SNARKs; Halo2 is newer, used in other projects like Scroll.

**Q: Doesn’t delegating proof generation to third parties weaken privacy?**
**A:** Yes, unless inputs are encrypted or zero-knowledge; third-party provers must be trusted or use secure MPC.

**Q: Does Monero use Halo2? Similar to Zcash?**
**A:** No, Monero uses ring signatures and bulletproofs, not Halo2. Differs from Zcash (ZK-SNARKs) in privacy approach.

**Q: How do co-SNARKs make it more private if more machines see private variables?**
**A:** Co-SNARKs distribute proving across parties; private inputs split via secret sharing, ensuring no single party sees full data.

**Q: Popular open-source ML agents making on-chain txs as bots? Performance measures?**
**A:** None widely known; check GitHub for ZKML bots (e.g., EZKL-based). Performance via backtesting (profit, gas efficiency).

**Q: Using OpenAI API for AI agent: ZK-proof only, not ZKML? Native model allows ZKML?**
**A:** Yes, API-based: ZK-proof of API call integrity. Native model: ZKML for full computation proof.

**Q: Project options limited to Mina or EZKL?**
**A:** No, open to any ZKML or Solidity-based project (e.g., ERC-7007, cross-chain, ZK proofs). Mina/EZKL are strong options.

**Q: Does Mina work off-chain?**
**A:** Mina’s blockchain is on-chain; uses recursive ZK-SNARKs for lightweight state. Off-chain computation possible with ZK proofs.

**Q: For Mina on-chain tx (e.g., paying USDC), on Mina blockchain or other chains (ETH/L2)?**
**A:** Mina native tx stays on Mina. Cross-chain (ETH/L2) requires bridges or oracles.

**Q: Why is NEAR called blockchain for AI?**
**A:** NEAR supports scalable smart contracts, sharding, and low-cost txs, suitable for AI workloads and on-chain ML inference.

**Q: Common protocols for secure MPC? IT-MACs and Vector OLEs?**
**A:** SPDZ, Shamir’s secret sharing, GMW. IT-MACs: integrity for MPC shares. Vector OLEs: efficient oblivious transfers for vector operations.

**Q: When to use Circom, Cairo, Noir, Rust EZKL?**
**A:** Circom: Ethereum ZK circuits (R1CS). Cairo: StarkNet/STARKs, general-purpose. Noir: High-level ZK DSL, user-friendly. EZKL: Rust-based ZKML for ML models.

**Q: On-chain options with EZKL?**
**A:** Deploy ZKML proofs as Solidity verifiers (e.g., MNIST classifier proof on Ethereum). Gas costs ~200k-500k per verification.

**Q: Classes resume next-next Monday?**
**A:** Confirm with course schedule; typically, yes.

**Q: For project, need both ZKML model and circuit? Two pieces of code?**
**A:** Yes, typically: ML model (e.g., ONNX) and ZK circuit (e.g., EZKL-generated) as separate codebases, integrated for proof generation/verification.
