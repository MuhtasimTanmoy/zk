### Sumcheck & Applications

**Q: How can lookup tables help with performance? Wouldn't a table require an entry for every field element, which would be impossibly huge?**<br/>
**A:** Lookup tables allow batching repeated computations by verifying membership in a smaller committed table. They don’t require entries for all field elements—only for the subset of values relevant to the computation.

**Q: Is Sumcheck used in a PIOP or a Commitment scheme? What is the purpose of evaluating over the hypercube, the output?**<br/>
**A:** Sumcheck is a PIOP (Polynomial Interactive Oracle Proof) protocol. Evaluating over the hypercube reduces multivariate sums to univariate checks, enabling efficient verification of large computations.

**Q: What are some use cases for Sumcheck?**<br/>
**A:** Polynomial identity testing, verifying large computations like matrix multiplication, GKR protocol for layered circuits, and proving ML model inference efficiently.

**Q: Why does GKR fit well with ML?**<br/>
**A:** ML models (e.g., neural nets) are structured as layered arithmetic circuits. GKR efficiently proves layered computations, making it a natural fit.

**Q: If the result of a computation is held in a table, is that result stored for all possible sets of inputs?**<br/>
**A:** No, only the necessary input-output pairs are stored. Tables are commitments to specific mappings, not exhaustive storage of all possibilities.

**Q: What determines that the lookup value is correct? Could a prior compute have stored the wrong value?**<br/>
**A:** Correctness is enforced by cryptographic commitments and proofs. A malicious prover can’t substitute wrong values without breaking the soundness of the proof system.

**Q: Can verifying model inference be done offline, even if not real time? Similar to fraud proofs?**<br/>
**A:** Yes. Verification can be delayed—like fraud proofs—since soundness doesn’t depend on real-time checks. Useful in ML auditing or offline compliance.

**Q: What does it mean to "prove a Twitter message"?**<br/>
**A:** It means generating a proof that a message came from a specific account (e.g., signature verification) or that it was included in a Merkle-ized set of posts.

**Q: Does OPML allow privacy of inputs?**<br/>
**A:** Presumably no—inputs are public in OPML settings. Privacy-preserving variants would require additional cryptographic layers.

**Q: Which proving systems are compatible with XGB (e.g., vs EZKL for neural networks)?**<br/>
**A:** Most current ZKML frameworks (like EZKL) focus on neural nets. XGB compatibility is limited, requiring custom circuit design or specialized frameworks.

**Q: If Ethereum switched to Poseidon (as Vitalik suggested), would proving Keccak become less useful?**<br/>
**A:** Yes. Native Poseidon would reduce the need for efficient Keccak proofs, shifting focus toward Poseidon-friendly circuits.

**Q: When are the sponsors coming?**<br/>
**A:** TBD (based on bootcamp announcements).

**Q: Will the link [https://zkml.bootcampnotes.xyz/](https://zkml.bootcampnotes.xyz/) remain available after the bootcamp?**<br/>
**A:** Yes, typically notes stay up post-bootcamp.

**Q: Can we submit PRs to the notes (e.g., fixing links)?**<br/>
**A:** Yes, PR contributions are usually welcomed for open-source course notes.
