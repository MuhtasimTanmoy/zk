### Frameworks, Learning & ZKML Trends

**Q: Does Zama have an equivalent of EZKL for FHE?**
**A:** Yes — [Concrete-ML](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete-ml) is Zama’s framework for privacy-preserving ML using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

**Q: RISC Zero educational resources?**
**A:** See [RISC Zero Education Hub](https://dev.risczero.com/education) for docs, tutorials, and developer guides on zkVMs and proof systems.

**Q: Recommendations for free online cryptography lectures (pairings, bulletproofs, etc.)?**
**A:**

* Dan Boneh’s [Stanford Cryptography I &amp; II]()
* MIT’s [Computer Science &amp; Cryptography courses on OpenCourseWare]()
* ETH Zurich’s lectures on advanced cryptography (YouTube).
* “Zero Knowledge Proofs” mini-course by Justin Thaler (for GKR, sumcheck, IOPs).

**Q: Is GKR the most used ZK scheme for ML? What other schemes are gaining traction?**
**A:** GKR is widely used for structured ML circuits (layered models). Other emerging contenders:

* **Plonkish systems** (Halo2, UltraPlonk) for flexible circuits.
* **STARKs** for scalability and transparency.
* **Lookup-optimized schemes** for efficient non-linear ops in ML.

**Q: Which areas are you personally most excited about / paying the most attention to?**
**A:** Folding schemes, recursive proofs for scalability, zkML model compatibility (beyond neural nets), and hybrid ZK + FHE approaches.

**Q: Is GKR doing recursion in layers?**
**A:** Yes. GKR verifies layered arithmetic circuits recursively by reducing multi-layer verification to simpler polynomial checks layer by layer.

**Q: Polyhedra doesn’t seem to support XGBoost models natively. Does that mean customization is required?**
**A:** Correct. You’d need to design a custom circuit for XGB operations since Polyhedra focuses on neural net inference.

**Q: After Web2 → Web3, will ZK (and ZKML) wrap everything Web2/Web3?**
**A:** Likely yes, for critical domains where **trust, privacy, and verifiability** matter (finance, AI, data sharing). ZK won’t replace all infra but will wrap key layers to ensure integrity and privacy in both Web2 and Web3 contexts.
