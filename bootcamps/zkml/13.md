### EZKL & Onnyx

**Q: What is EZKL?**

**A:** EZKL is a Rust-based library for generating zero-knowledge proofs of ML inference. It compiles ONNX models into zk-SNARK circuits, enabling verifiable inference on Ethereum and other blockchains.

**Q: What is Onnyx?**

**A:** Onnyx is a framework for compiling and representing ML models into ZK-friendly formats. It focuses on model structure, data representation, and efficient proof generation.

**Q: How does Onnyx handle tensors?**

**A:** Tensors (multidimensional arrays) are the core data structure in ML. Onnyx defines tensor operations in a ZK-circuit-compatible way to preserve efficiency.

**Q: What does “Freeze AST” mean in Onnyx?**

**A:** “Freeze AST” means converting the model’s Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into a fixed, immutable representation. This ensures reproducibility and deterministic circuit generation.

**Q: What role does Protocol Buffer play in Onnyx?**

**A:** Protocol Buffers (protobuf) provide a standardized, compact way to serialize model data and computation graphs, ensuring compatibility across systems and ZK backends.
