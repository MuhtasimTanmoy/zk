### Class 6 QA

**Q: What is salt?**
**A:** Salt is a random value added to inputs (e.g., passwords) before hashing to prevent precomputed attacks (e.g., rainbow tables) and ensure unique outputs.

**Q: What is the host driver?**
**A:** Host driver in ZK contexts (e.g., RISC Zero) is the software managing the execution environment for the guest program (ELF binary) in a zkVM, facilitating proof generation.

**Q: Can we check Alice's password with the proof?**
**A:** Yes, ZK proof can verify if Alice’s password matches a hashed value without revealing the password, using a circuit comparing input to commitment.

**Q: Mechanisms to verify completeness of ZK circuits for all valid password combinations?**
**A:** Formal verification, exhaustive testing, or SMT solvers (e.g., Solidity’s SMT Checker) ensure circuits cover all valid cases. Audit circuit logic for edge cases.

**Q: Is the 1MB program size limit for the ELF binary?**
**A:** Yes, refers to ELF binary size in zkVMs (e.g., RISC Zero), limiting guest program complexity to ensure efficient proving.

**Q: Issue with proof if Rust program generates "real" random numbers? Outsource randomness?**
**A:** Real randomness breaks ZK determinism; proofs require fixed inputs. Outsource randomness (e.g., via VRFs or commitments) to maintain verifiability.

**Q: Has World ID solved people selling their identities?**
**A:** No complete solution; World ID uses iris biometrics and ZK proofs to link identity uniquely, but economic incentives for selling persist. Detection relies on behavioral analysis.

**Q: How to guarantee one iris never generates two different identities?**
**A:** World ID uses iris hashing with uniqueness checks (e.g., collision-resistant hash) and ZK proofs to ensure one iris maps to one identity, verified against a global registry.
