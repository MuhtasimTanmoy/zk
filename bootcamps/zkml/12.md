### Axiom & OpenVM

**Q: What is Axiom?**<br/>
**A:** Axiom is a ZK coprocessor for Ethereum. It lets smart contracts query historical Ethereum data or perform off-chain computations, with results verified on-chain via zero-knowledge proofs.

**Q: What is OpenVM?**<br/>
**A:** OpenVM is a zkVM (zero-knowledge virtual machine) framework. It executes arbitrary programs inside a verifiable environment, producing succinct proofs of correct execution. It generalizes zkEVM concepts to arbitrary instruction sets and domains.
