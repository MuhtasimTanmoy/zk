### OPML, Security & Advanced Topics

**Q: Could fields with order close to 64-bit be secure enough for serious use?**

**A:** No. A 64-bit field offers at most ~64 bits of security, which is far below modern standards (128+ bits). Such fields are useful for toy examples, not production-grade cryptography.

**Q: Isn’t it very hard to prove the challenge in OPML?**

**A:** Yes. OPML (Optimistic ML) inherits complexity from both ML inference and fraud-proof design. The challenge is encoding inference into efficiently verifiable steps.

**Q: Is there any tool that uses OPML?**

**A:** Currently, no widely adopted tools. Most OPML ideas are still in research or prototype phase.

**Q: Would OPML fraud proofs require that inference is deterministic? If not, how could you verify fraud?**

**A:** Yes, determinism is critical. If inference isn’t deterministic (e.g., due to floating point quirks), fraud proofs break down since two honest parties could disagree.

**Q: Are there zkML applications where inference and proof are made in parallel (proof later)?**

**A:** Yes. Some systems allow inference to run normally and generate a proof afterward (offline proving). This decouples latency-sensitive inference from slower proof generation.

**Q: Does the latency of fraud proof windows in OPML limit use cases?**

**A:** Yes. For time-sensitive apps, fraud-proof windows may be too slow. For financial use cases (like OP rollups), latency can be mitigated with liquidity providers, but ML inference adds complexity.

**Q: What about quantization randomness in FP inference across hardware?**

**A:** This is a real challenge. Tiny deviations in floating-point ops (e.g., CPU vs GPU) can yield different outputs, undermining determinism for fraud proofs. Quantized integer inference is more reliable.

**Q: Example paper on this issue?**

**A:** See [arXiv:2402.02675](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02675) for analysis of determinism and randomness in ML inference.

**Q: Interested in a session on folding schemes?**

**A:** Yes—folding schemes combine multiple instances into one, useful for scalable zkML verification.

**Q: Sharing thinking trends from Denver would be useful?**

**A:** Definitely—Denver conferences often surface early-stage zkML and scaling trends.

**Q: TEE utilization in ZKML: are there benefits in training computation and verification?**

**A:** TEEs can accelerate training and provide trusted execution, but they shift trust from cryptographic proofs to hardware. Hybrid TEE+ZK approaches are an active research area.

**Q: ML model explainability (how models make predictions)?**

**A:** Explainability methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME) analyze decision paths. Integrating these into zk proofs is non-trivial, but could prove not only outputs but why they occurred.

**Q: Interested in live coding?**

**A:** Yes—live circuit building, folding demos, or EZKL sessions would be valuable.

**Q: zk cryptographic basics theory?**

**A:** Covers commitments, Fiat–Shamir, polynomial IOPs, and security assumptions. Essential for understanding zkML.

**Q: A detailed session on commitment schemes (FRI, KZG, Pedersen) with intuition?**

**A:** Yes.

* **FRI** : probabilistic low-degree testing.
* **KZG** : polynomial commitments with pairing-based succinct proofs.
* **Pedersen** : binding and hiding commitments via discrete logs.

**Q: BBS signature schemes?**

**A:** BBS+ allows selective disclosure of credentials (privacy-preserving). Draft: [BBS IRTF spec](https://identity.foundation/bbs-signature/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures.html).

**Q: circom/cairo circuit implementation examples for Bulletproofs and Groth16?**

**A:** Examples exist in open-source repos, showing how to encode range proofs (Bulletproofs) and R1CS circuits (Groth16).

**Q: Bulletproofs?**

**A:** Short non-interactive proofs without trusted setup. Good for range proofs, but less scalable for complex ML circuits.

**Q: zk-SNARKs vs zk-STARKs?**

**A:**

* **SNARKs** : succinct, fast verification, require trusted setup.
* **STARKs** : transparent (no setup), post-quantum secure, larger proof sizes.

**Q: Recursive ZK proofs?**

**A:** Technique where a proof attests to the validity of another proof, enabling scalable verification (e.g., proof aggregation, rollups).
