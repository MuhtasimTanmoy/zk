### Class 2

**Q: How are ZK-SNARKs better than digital signatures for the AI-attested audio experiment podcast? Can all use cases be handled by digital signing?**
**A:** ZK-SNARKs prove computation (e.g., audio authenticity via attested microphone) without revealing private data. Digital signatures only verify origin, not computation integrity.

**Q: Are activation functions derived from experimentation? Do nodes use different activation functions?**
**A:** Derived via experimentation; same function used per layer across all nodes.

**Q: How does the ReLU function introduce non-linearity?**
**A:** ReLU (max(0, x)) outputs 0 for x â‰¤ 0, linear for x > 0; non-linearity from "killing" negative values, enabling sparse representations.

**Q: Difference between sigmoid and softmax curves?**
**A:** Sigmoid: Single [0,1] output for binary classification. Softmax: Vector outputs summing to 1 for multi-class probabilities.

**Q: Can Softmax output be more complex than a scalar, e.g., a vector?**
**A:** Yes, outputs vector for multi-class probabilities (e.g., [0.1, 0.7, 0.2] for 3 classes).

**Q: What are gradients exactly?**
**A:** Partial derivatives of loss with respect to model parameters; used in backpropagation to update weights.

**Q: Is there a playground to visualize sigmoid and its derivatives?**
**A:** Use Python/NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 400)
sigmoid = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
derivative = sigmoid * (1 - sigmoid)

plt.plot(x, sigmoid, label='Sigmoid')
plt.plot(x, derivative, label='Derivative')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Plots S-curve and bell-shaped derivative.

**Q: Exact URL for ZoKrates example in Remix?**
**A:** [https://remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org). Activate ZoKrates plugin via Plugin Manager, create new file, paste ZoKrates code, compile/setup/export verifier.
