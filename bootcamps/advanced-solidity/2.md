Formal Verification

- [Assembly EVM Opcodes and Formal Verification Course](https://github.com/Cyfrin/assembly-evm-opcodes-and-formal-verification-course) — Course material for EVM opcode-level understanding and verification techniques.
- [EVM Codes](https://www.evm.codes) — Interactive reference for Ethereum Virtual Machine opcodes / gas costs.
- `cast to-base 0x20 base` — (CLI / tooling snippet) translates numeric data into base-20 format; useful in encoding/decoding.
- **Certora** — A tool / platform for smart contract formal verification using specification languages.
- **Halmos** — (Context maybe formal methods or verification tooling) — needs further lookup.
- **Formal Verification Techniques**

  - Symbolic Execution → using SMT/SAT solvers to explore possible execution paths.
  - Abstract Interpretation → over-approximation to reason about all possible inputs.
  - Model Testing → checking models / implementations against specifications.
- [Curve DeFi Advanced 2024 Repository](https://github.com/Cyfrin/advanced-defi-2024) — Deep dive into Curve (DeFi) code + architecture.
