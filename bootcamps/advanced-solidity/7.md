**Class 7 QA**

**Q: How does bridging work from L1 to L2 and vice versa? How many smart contracts used?**
**A:** Funds locked in L1 bridge, L2 bridge mints tokens (2 bridges + token contracts; minimum 3 with relayers).

**Q: On evm.codes, SSTORE minimum gas 100 seems low; logs more expensive?**
**A:** Misleading; 100 minimum if no change. New slot 20k, setting to 0 is 5k.

**Q: Good practice to fully fill 32 bytes in memory slot vs. multiple slots?**
**A:** Yes, packing (e.g., 4 uint64s into uint256) is gas-efficient.

**Q: How can single uint256 replace multiple arguments? Techniques/guides?**
**A:** All data is bits. See [Solidity Gas Optimization: Data Compression](https://blog.emn178.cc/en/post/solidity-gas-optimization-data-compression/).

**Q: Are Yul commands same as Solidity opcodes? Differences?**
**A:** Yul corresponds directly to EVM opcodes (e.g., PUSH1, DUP1).

**Q: Advantages of sidechain, rollup, validium?**
**A:** Sidechains: independent security. Rollups: inherit Ethereum security. Validiums: highest scalability, off-chain data risks.

**Q: Basic difference between sidechains, validiums, channels?**
**A:** Laurence explaining live.

**Q: What makes validium different from ZK rollups?**
**A:** Both use ZK; difference in data availability: ZK-Rollups on-chain, Validiums off-chain (higher throughput, data risks).

**Q: When to use YUL vs. assembly as Solidity dev?**
**A:** Inline assembly for small optimizations; standalone Yul for complex modules.

**Q: What if fraud proof not generated for wrong batch? Who generates?**
**A:** L2 and external actors (paid for fraud discovery).

**Q: How to create fraud proof?**
**A:** Reconstruct L2 state transition, compare to sequencer root, submit evidence to L1.

**Q: What is StarkNet? L2?**
**A:** Yes, L2 using zk-STARKs.

**Q: Is zkSync fully EVM compatible?**
**A:** No.

**Q: Why so many L2 chains instead of one?**
**A:** Different solutions (scalability, privacy, tradeoffs); business reasons (tokens).

**Q: Gas optimization tools? Remix shows gas?**
**A:** Foundry/Hardhat for detailed reports. Remix provides basic gas reporting.

**Q: What is "solc optimizer"? Part of EVM?**
**A:** Part of Solidity compiler (solc).

**Q: Storage packing and bitwise extraction?**
**A:** Ask Laurence.

**Q: Access read.ai meeting notes?**
**A:** Need the app to view.

**Q: Local variable in loop cheaper than external outside function?**
**A:** Yes, local (memory/stack) cheaper than state (SLOAD).
