### Class 11 QA

**Q: What are some ways to transition into a Web3 security role? Do I need to be a senior software engineer? (I’m a frontend dev)**<br/>
**A:** Start with audit competitions, audit projects pro bono, share results on GitHub, specialize in a niche, then apply for jobs. No senior SWE required; focus is enough. FE background is fine—build ZK/audit skills.

**Q: Favorite formatter/PDF generator for audit reports?**<br/>
**A:** Obsidian for reports. Extropy uses bash script to generate Markdown from GitHub Issues.

**Q: Does Extropy/Encode have a public repo of all past audits?**<br/>
**A:** Partial public audits at [security.extropy.io/audits](https://security.extropy.io/audits).

**Q: How long does a full audit take at Extropy for small vs. large codebases?**<br/>
**A:** Medium codebase: 2 weeks from code/documentation freeze to initial audit.

**Q: Tools or rules for auditing assembly code? What if the contract is full of assembly? Can you decline?**<br/>
**A:** Manual line-by-line analysis (stack/memory safety, opcodes). Never seen full Assembly codebase; can decline if needed.

**Q: Comment: Today’s lesson was very interesting and useful!**<br/>
**A:** Marvelous, thank you!

**Q: Are there platforms like Code4rena for developers?**<br/>
**A:** Hackathons, Gitcoin, OnlyDust.com, DeveloperDAO.

**Q: What about AI auditors and similar tools?**<br/>
**A:** Exist but limited. Nethermind Research developing one. Use AI to check your code.

**Q: For the code obfuscation lesson, do we need to register or inform anywhere?**<br/>
**A:** Ask Laurence on Discord or Technical Questions channel.

**Q: Was the EthDenver talk mentioned by Laurence recorded? Can you share the link?**<br/>
**A:** No specific link found; search "EthDenver partial contract deployment talk" for similar content.
