**Q: Why do security auditors prefer Foundry over Hardhat?**<br/>
**A:** Foundry is easier to work with; offers better testing features. Hardhat is still viable. See [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethdev/comments/13yd95m/foundry_or_hardhat/).<br/>
**A:** Foundry allows writing tests in Solidity, increasing language exposure.<br/>
**A:** Forge > Hardhat for usability.<br/>

**Q: What’s the significance of Uniswap’s “slot0”?**<br/>
**A:** Uniswap V3/V4 stores critical pool data in slot0 for efficiency. See [Uniswap V3 Docs](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/core/interfaces/pool/IUniswapV3PoolState#slot0).

**Q: What’s the advantage of UUPS over Transparent proxies?**<br/>
**A:** UUPS includes upgrade functionality in the implementation contract, allowing removal later. Uniswap V4 used UUPS for gas-efficient address (many zeros). See [Uniswap V4 Address](https://v4-address.uniswap.org/).

**Q: How does a contract address with many zeros save gas?**<br/>
**A:** Leading zeros reduce gas costs in address encoding.<br/>
**A:** Vanity addresses can compromise security (e.g., $160M hack in 2022).<br/>
**A:** Gas optimization has trade-offs but is effective if done correctly.<br/>
**A:** Vanity EOAs differ from contract addresses; some vanity address tools were exploitable.<br/>

**Q: What’s the Branching Tree Technique?**<br/>
**A:** By Paul Berg and Sablier, it’s useful for writing tests.

**Q: What’s the purpose of the scripts folder in Foundry?**<br/>
**A:** Primarily for deployment scripts; rarely needs editing.

**Q: How to target specific tests in Foundry?**<br/>
**A:** Use `forge test --mt` or `--match-path` for specific tests.

**Q: What’s the best pattern for blockchain games or multi-user upgradable contracts?**<br/>
**A:** User count doesn’t affect pattern choice.<br/>
**A:** Beacon Proxy is best for upgradable multi-user contracts.

**Q: Can a contract be redeployed to the same address with CREATE2 after SELFDESTRUCT?**<br/>
**A:** No, SELFDESTRUCT is irrelevant; CREATE2 address is deterministic.

**Q: Is it good practice to separate storage, errors, events, and modifiers into interfaces?**<br/>
**A:** Depends on complexity; not necessary for small contracts.

**Q: What language is Foundry/Forge/Cast written in?**<br/>
**A:** Rust.

**Q: How is the deploy address determined?**<br/>
**A:** Calculated via CREATE/CREATE2 equations.

**Q: What happens if deploying to an occupied address?**<br/>
**A:** Transaction reverts.

**Q: Can the Diamond Pattern be used without upgradability for storage benefits?**<br/>
**A:** Yes, but Ethereum’s storage limit (2^256 slots) is already vast.

**Q: Are there issues with different Solidity versions in proxy vs. implementation contracts?**<br/>
**A:** Best practice is to use the same version to avoid compatibility issues.

**Q: How does a proxy inherit storage and point to implementation?**<br/>
**A:** Proxy inherits storage contract and uses a pointer to the implementation contract.

**Q: Can storage variables be removed in a new implementation?**<br/>
**A:** No, storage variables cannot be removed due to layout compatibility.

**Q: How does delegatecall update state if calling implementation?**<br/>
**A:** Delegatecall only used if method doesn’t exist in proxy; proxy methods update its state.<br/>
**A:** Implementation holds no state; state resides in proxy.

**Q: What’s a manual upgrade process?**<br/>
**A:** Deploy new contract (paused), pause old contract, migrate data, unpause new contract, update app.

**Q: Is an audit needed for contract upgrades in production?**<br/>
**A:** Yes, new version should be audited; upgrade process rarely audited but should be.

**Q: Why use PUSH1 over other PUSH opcodes?**<br/>
**A:** PUSH1 pushes 1 byte; compiler selects based on data size.

**Q: Why are settlement and data availability different?**<br/>
**A:** Settlement ensures security; data availability focuses on cheap storage.

**Q: Why is a sequencer needed?**<br/>
**A:** Handles transaction ordering and batching.

**Q: Can hash be used as encryption in ZK?**<br/>
**A:** Used for commitments/integrity, not data recovery.

**Q: Where are videos uploaded?**<br/>
**A:** Read Me channel in Slack.

**Q: Why was the 2016 Ethereum DAO attack resolved with a hard fork, not a contract upgrade?**<br/>
**A:** Hard fork reverted chain state; unrelated to contract upgradability.

**Q: What’s stored in slot 0 of an inherited contract?**<br/>
**A:** Owner address.

**Q: Where to submit homework?**
**A:** No submission required; answers reviewed later.

**Q: Can loops be implemented in Huff with opcodes?**
**A:** Yes, using conditional jumps (JUMPI) or recursion; stack depth limited to 1024.
