### Class 10 QA

**Q: How do rug pulls use fake “balanceOf”?**<br/>
**A:** Some rug pulls manipulate `balanceOf` to show limited balances while one account holds `uint256` max. See [Rug Pull Analysis](https://hugomasclet.com/rug-pull-analysis) and [Dame Post](https://dame.mirror.xyz/5xbwbVzWcO8vQkEIGlMaUjXNM6UNM8labiN-5QkVCHM).

**Q: Was the attacker just lucky with brute-forcing?**<br/>
**A:** Not luck; attacker had to discover the issue to brute-force, implying skill and effort.

**Q: What’s the typical audit process? Static review? Manual/automatic testing?**<br/>
**A:** Covered in lecture; includes static review, manual/automatic testing, and more.

**Q: Possible mechanisms for signaling token deposits from Chain A to Chain B?**<br/>
**A:** Cross-chain messaging protocols: trusted bridges (oracles/relayers), light client verification, or optimistic verification to lock/burn on Chain A and mint/unlock on Chain B.

**Q: Can you refuse to receive ETH in your contract?**<br/>
**A:** Yes, omit `receive` or payable methods. Include a fallback/receive function to return funds to sender.

**Q: Good contract monitoring tools for events emitted?**<br/>
**A:** Tenderly, OpenZeppelin Defender, Alchemu, Infura, Moralis offer event monitoring.

**Q: Is it common for `tx.origin` != `msg.sender`?**<br/>
**A:** Yes, when a contract calls another contract. `tx.origin` is the original EOA; `msg.sender` is the immediate caller.

**Q: Is including fallback & receive good practice in every contract?**<br/>
**A:** No, only include if needed. Omitting `receive` prevents Ether receipt, reverting transfers. Fallback adds complexity and risks if not carefully implemented.
