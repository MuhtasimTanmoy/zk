# Introduction

**Q: Prerequisites for course? Solidity knowledge needed?**<br/>
**A:** See how it goes; work harder if lost. We help to ensure completion.

**Q: Using Hardhat mostly; want to learn Foundry. Will course guide basics?**<br/>
**A:** Yes, Foundry is bootcamp's Solidity dev env.

**Q: Execution layer of Ethereum: executes SCs or just transactions?**<br/>
**A:** Executes both (SC deployment and transactions interacting with SCs).

**Q: Ethereum L1 and Beacon chain same for settlement/consensus?**<br/>
**A:** Yes, interchangeable for settlement/consensus.

**Q: Why settlement and data availability different?**<br/>
**A:** Settlement focuses on security; data availability on cheap storage.

**Q: Pie chart shown—no BTC? What was it about?**<br/>
**A:** Bitcoin was there; see "Bitcoin..." slide.

**Q: Is Polygon L2 or sidechain? Difference?**<br/>
**A:** Sidechain. L2 inherits Ethereum security; sidechain has own security + bridge.

**Q: Idea behind forced TXs? No proof needed? Loophole for fraud?**<br/>
**A:** Executes on L1, follows L1 rules; no proof needed.

**Q: Why sequencer needed?**<br/>
**A:** Handles/processes all transactions.

**Q: Interested in blockchain transaction analysis for NFTs (ERC721/1155). Covered?**<br/>
**A:** NFTs covered; suggest transaction analysis topic.

**Q: Notes on qualifying for other blockchain dev after advanced Solidity/Ethereum? Extrapolate lessons?**<br/>
**A:** Suggest in topics.

**Q: Why sequencer well-behaved assumption? TXs pushed to L1? Data from L2 block?**<br/>
**A:** Sequencer centralization risk (censorship, fraud, MEV, liveness failure).

**Q: Basic overview of blockchains (non-BTC/ETH) from sidechain/L2/modularity POVs? Add to slides?**<br/>
**A:** Suggest in Polls.

**Q: Forced transaction validation flow same for rollups?**<br/>
**A:** Varies by rollup, but purpose same.

**Q: Sequencer centralized—why force TXs? Specific examples? How ID?**<br/>
**A:** Enables execution if sequencer misbehaves.

**Q: Follow-up on transactions in Zoom chat?**<br/>
**A:** Post in Slido; rules require questions there.

**Q: With 100k TPS on Ethereum + L2s, enough?**<br/>
**A:** Yes.

**Q: Transaction analysis: NFT sales, royalties, fees. Common architectures for collections/marketplaces? Data retrieval practices?**<br/>
**A:** Analyze popular NFT collections' verified code on Ethereum.

**Q: Walk-through of Vitalik article? Deep dive Ethereum roadmap?**<br/>
**A:** Suggest in topics.

**Q: Main skillset for blockchain engineer qualified for all jobs (core skills)?**<br/>
**A:** Suggest in topics.

**Q: Topic: EVM on node/server/Linux architecture/working?**<br/>
**A:** Suggest in topics.

**Q: Go over The Graph? Typical integration?**<br/>
**A:** Suggest in topics.

**Q: Equation of Ethereum EC? Values of a and b?**<br/>
**A:** Same as BTC (secp256k1): a=0, b=7.

**Q: Can hash be used for encryption in ZK?**<br/>
**A:** No, for commitments/integrity checks, not data recovery.

**Q: CTF with cryptographic work around Ethereum? Link to past?**<br/>
**A:** Part of our CTF; link shared soon.

**Q: Repeat finite fields/polynomials?**<br/>
**A:** Recording available tomorrow on Discord.

**Q: EIP-1153 live?**<br/>
**A:** Yes.

**Q: What is airdrop? Why do companies do it?**<br/>
**A:** Free token transfer to qualified recipients; generates interest, incentivizes use.

**Q: Why `block.timestamp` available if inaccurate?**<br/>
**A:** Block producer's machine time; approximate timing.

**Q: Futarchy voting as governance alternative?**<br/>
**A:** Promising/unproven; for specific decisions. Optimism experiment: [Butter Games](https://butter.games/market/0x98c82be3039640afa222213bfbe1980b94d15172).

**Q: Deployment advice for dApps? Launch on Sepolia before prod?**<br/>
**A:** More testing better; Sepolia good, mainnet forks effective.

**Q: Slippage show on-chain?**<br/>
**A:** Yes.

**Q: Lost 98% = 98% slippage?**<br/>
**A:** Check tx: `amountOutMinimum=0` means 100% slippage.

**Q: Parallel EVM like sharding?**<br/>
**A:** No. Sharding divides state/validation; parallel EVM processes non-conflicting txs concurrently. Complementary.

**Q: Lesson materials duration? PDF slides?**<br/>
**A:** No deletion planned. Export PDF from slides; Markdown source: view-source:[Lesson 16](https://solidity.bootcampnotes.xyz/lesson16.html).

**Q: SMT Checker?**<br/>
**A:** Solidity static analysis for formal verification; catches overflows, unreachable code, unsafe assertions.

**Q: Finish CTF to pass bootcamp?**<br/>
**A:** No, good skill exercise.
