### Uniswap V4 & Hooks Q&A

**Q: Is this for a new pool of a new coin to connect to US V4?**
**A:** Yes, Uniswap V4 allows custom pools with hooks for new tokens.

**Q: Are you aware of mechanisms using V4 hooks to redistribute surplus from differential fees to passive providers (non-JIT attackers)?**
**A:** Yes, e.g., Jitterbug (saucepoint repo) redistributes MEV to passive LPs via hooks. Search Uniswap V4 hooks for more.

**Q: Can I call this usage bitmap (the way you use the flag)?**
**A:** Yes, bitmaps/flags track usage efficiently in V4 storage.

**Q: Can’t rely on fuzz testing here?**
**A:** Limited; use formal verification for sensitive logic in V4 hooks.

**Q: Joined late, what’s the context?**
**A:** Discussing Uniswap V4 templates, hooks for fee redistribution, JIT attacks, mempool monitoring.

**Q: How to monitor mempool in Foundry Solidity scripts for JIT attacks? Need Hardhat/JS?**
**A:** Foundry lacks direct mempool access in Solidity; use Hardhat/JS (web3.js/ethers.js) or external tools like Anvil forks. Txpool_inspect is Geth-specific.

**Q: Does this approach only apply to swapping?**
**A:** No, V4 hooks can apply to any pool action (e.g., liquidity adds/removes).

**Q: For obvious MEV like Compound liquidations, does this punish first executors?**
**A:** Yes, if hooks penalize aggressive actions; balances passive vs. active via fee redistribution.
