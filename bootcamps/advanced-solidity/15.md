### Class 15 QA

**Q: Why is `block.timestamp` available if inaccurate?**
**A:** Reflects block producer's machine time; not 100% accurate but useful for approximate timing.

**Q: Thoughts on futarchy voting as an alternative governance model?**
**A:** Promising but unproven; best for specific decisions, not broad governance. Large futarchy experiment on Optimism: [Butter Games](https://butter.games/market/0x98c82be3039640afa222213bfbe1980b94d15172).

**Q: Deployment advice for new dApps? Launch on Sepolia testnet before production?**
**A:** Extensive testing recommended; Sepolia testnet useful, but mainnet fork testing yields great results.

**Q: Does slippage show on-chain?**
**A:** Yes.

**Q: If someone lost 98%, was their slippage 98%?**
**A:** Check transaction via "Decode transaction input"; `amountOutMinimum` set to 0 means 100% slippage.

**Q: Is parallel EVM like sharding?**
**A:** No. Sharding divides blockchain state/validation across shards; parallel EVM processes non-conflicting transactions concurrently. Complementary techniques.

**Q: How long will lesson materials remain available? Can we get PDF versions of slides?**
**A:** No plans to delete materials. Export PDFs from slides or use Markdown source: [Lesson 16](view-source:https://solidity.bootcampnotes.xyz/lesson16.html).
