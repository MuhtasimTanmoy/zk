### Class 3 Q&A

**Q: Can we schedule time to discuss the last questions from Exercises 1 and 2 of the homework?**<br/>
**A:** Laurence will review homework answers in session.

**Q: Why is calldata needed/useful?**<br/>
**A:** Ensures data integrity before storage, preventing manipulation.

**Q: Can we discuss yesterday’s homework?**<br/>
**A:** Students encouraged to complete independently; review later.

**Q: Do we have to submit homework deliverables, and are there deadlines?**<br/>
**A:** Final project, CTF, gas optimization require submission; current ones don’t.

**Q: How does contract B know contract A’s state if updating non-existent state?**<br/>
**A:** Answered live by Laurence.

**Q: Why are settlement and data availability different?**<br/>
**A:** Settlement ensures security; data availability focuses on cheap data storage.

**Q: Why is a sequencer needed?**<br/>
**A:** Handles and processes transactions for ordering and batching.

**Q: Can hash be used as encryption in ZK?**<br/>
**A:** Used for commitments/integrity checks, not data recovery.

**Q: What’s a Bloom filter and its use in EVM?**<br/>
**A:** Probabilistic structure in block headers; helps light clients find relevant logs efficiently.

**Q: Why do function selector arguments start with 1 and 2?**<br/>
**A:** Mistake in notes; should start with 0.

**Q: What’s “Byzantium” in EVM context?**<br/>
**A:** Ethereum hard fork introducing new features/opcodes.

**Q: Why is emitting events considered state modification?**<br/>
**A:** Adds logs to block receipts, affecting receipts root in blockchain state.

**Q: What’s immutable virtual ROM in EVM?**<br/>
**A:** Contract bytecode, immutable once deployed.

**Q: How can code store data?**<br/>
**A:** Store data in contract storage; read via contract interactions.

**Q: Are all 16 stack elements in Solidity available for operations?**<br/>
**A:** Yes, LIFO stack used for internal function arguments.

**Q: What’s saving a word/byte to memory?**<br/>
**A:** Word: 32-byte write to memory; byte: 1-byte write.

**Q: Are 1000 stack slots available, or unlimited storage?**<br/>
**A:** Stack limited to 1024 slots; storage slots practically unlimited (2^256).

**Q: Can mappings be stored in memory?**<br/>
**A:** No, mappings are storage-only; values can be copied to memory.

**Q: What’s the DUP opcode?**<br/>
**A:** Duplicates top stack item.

**Q: Why does SELFDESTRUCT opcode exist?**<br/>
**A:** Destroys contract, refunds storage gas.

**Q: Testing logic in Yul/Huff?**<br/>
**A:** Use Hardhat/Foundry for testing.

**Q: Example of delegatecall?**
**A:** See [Gist](https://gist.github.com/foxreymann/5d6c2044ff02459bb9bfe1528a32891e).

**Q: Can contract B delegatecall contract C while managing contract A’s state?**
**A:** Yes, delegatecall modifies caller’s (A’s) state.
