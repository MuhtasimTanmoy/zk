# Class 2 - FHE

## Zero-Knowledge Q&A Notes

Q: Verifier knows value of H(x) only for a few points, so he can't compute the H(x). <br/>
A: Yes, the verifier only learns evaluations at limited points.

Q: Why? If verifier does enough samples can’t they do Lagrange interpolation?<br/>
A: Yes, but usually the verifier knows far too few points to do the interpolation.

Q: Does this mean we should work in an ideal generated by the polynomial? <Z> ∈ k[x], is that info good enough?<br/>
A: Yes, generally we can, but we don’t know what multiple of Z that way.

Q: If the verifier is able to compute H(x), is it still a zero knowledge protocol?<br/>
A: Verifier only knows H(x) at a few points, so they can’t reconstruct the whole polynomial. That preserves zero knowledge.

Q: Who comes up / decides on the polynomial to be used between the prover and the verifier?<br/>
A: After all processing, the ZKP essentially reduces to a polynomial — the system/protocol design dictates it.

Q: K, ZCash, MPC, FHE – Q&A Notes<br/>
A: Randomness & Trusted Setup

Q: Can we delete our random secret once the ceremony is completed?<br/>
A: Yes, properly destroying this secret ensures the setup remains secure.

Q: What do you mean by randomness taken from laptop?<br/>
A: You can have randomness from entropy generated by people moving the mouse, keyboard input, etc.

## ZCash & Trusted Setup Ceremony

Q: What exactly was the ZK aspect of ZCash?<br/>
A: ZCash is a privacy-protecting digital currency that uses zk-SNARKs to hide transaction details.

Q: What if the VM that ZCash sent out was compromised itself?<br/>
A: If there is a bug or backdoor in the VM, then the trusted setup won’t solve the problem.

Q: Does increasing the number of people involved in the ceremony increase or decrease security?<br/>
A: Increase — more participants make it harder for all to collude.

Q: Then how can we make sure that they have got rid of the toxic waste?<br/>
A: You can’t; you have to trust the participants to dispose of it.

Q: Is there a way to conclude cheating has been done if all participants are dishonest?<br/>
A: Yes, you can check the proof and reverify — an invalid proof will be detected.

## SNARKs & Schemes

Q: Are the Creator and Prover the same?<br/>
A: Not necessarily.

Q: Are there SNARK schemes that do not involve toxic waste?<br/>
A: Yes, there are SNARK systems that don’t require toxic waste (e.g., transparent SNARKs).

## MPC & Fiat-Shamir

Q: What is MPC again?<br/>
A: Multi-Party Computation.

Q: Is the test system configuration that eliminates interactivity with MPC what is called the Fiat-Shamir scheme?<br/>
A: No, you’re mixing two different things.

## CRS (Common Reference String)

Q: Is CRS the public variable?<br/>
A: No, this is a common reference string, used as part of the setup of the system.

Q: What is the typical size of a CRS?<br/>
A: They can vary in size, but can be very large.

## zkSNARKs & Complexity

Q: zkSNARKs are basically hash functions?<br/>
A: No, zkSNARKs are a cryptographic framework that leverages multiple cryptographic primitives (including hash functions) to achieve privacy, efficiency, and security.

Q: Does it have anything to do with P/NP?<br/>
A: Yes, NP problems are hard to solve but easy to verify, which motivates zero-knowledge proofs.

Q: What are P and NP?<br/>
A:
P: Problems solvable in polynomial time.
NP: Problems where solutions can be verified in polynomial time, but may not be solvable in deterministic polynomial time.
FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)

Q: Could you give a few examples of FHE uses on blockchain?<br/>
A: Examples include private computation on-chain, confidential smart contracts, and encrypted voting.

Q: Is FHE possible with elliptic curve cryptography?<br/>
A: Most FHE implementations today are based on other mathematical foundations, but adapting them to elliptic curves might be possible.

Q: If we have FHE, why do we need ZK?<br/>
A: ZK is useful because proofs are short and verification is efficient, while FHE is heavy. They serve different use cases.

Q: Can FHE work on any kind of data (e.g., text)?<br/>
A: Yes, in principle FHE can work on arbitrary data types once encoded, though performance varies.

## ZKP Properties

Q: What is meant by “high probability” in completeness?<br/>
A: It means there is a negligible chance of accepting a false proof.

Q: Does completeness require the verifier to be honest?<br/>
A: Yes, completeness assumes the verifier is honest.
