# ZK & Rollups — Q&A Notes

Q: How long did it take Laurence to become proficient enough in zk to teach this course?
A: Laurence has an engineering background (MSc, software engineer). He started looking into ZK in 2017, which gave him years to build expertise.

Q: How do we determine which aspects are worth proving with ZK? Is there a model or framework?
A: Factors include privacy requirements, trust minimisation, regulatory/compliance needs. No single formal framework exists yet.

Q: Who are the prover and verifier here?
A: Prover = user (e.g., Laurence). Verifier = smart contract.

Q: Why do we need elliptic curves here?
A: Groth16 and similar proving schemes are built on elliptic curve cryptography.

Q: Can private variables used in the proof be reverse-engineered?
A: No.

Q: Does ZoKrates translate the code into a circuit?
A: Yes, it compiles into a circuit that runs in Solidity.

Q: When you click on Compute, is the proof generated?
A: No. Compute just checks constraint satisfaction. Proof generation is a separate step.

Q: If we change the input and witness, do we redeploy?
A:
    Change program → redo setup (new CRS).
    Change input → no redeployment needed.

Q: Is the assert determining what’s being proved?
A: Yes. It encodes the claim the prover wants to prove.

Q: Who decides the inputs?
A: The prover.

Q: What is meant by “real world” in the earlier diagram? Web3 only?
A: It could be Web3 contracts or any Web2 application.

Q: Why would a blockchain choose SNARKs if proof storage is large?
A: Trade-offs exist: SNARKs are small/fast proofs but expensive setup/storage; STARKs avoid trusted setup but proofs are larger.

Q: Why not Monero in ZK course?
A: Monero uses different techniques; zk elements are minimal and complex. Will be covered later.

Q: In treaty verification, how would an adversarial nation confirm machines are decommissioned?
A: By using real-world data (e.g., aerial photos) and proving aspects of it cryptographically.

Q: Does Ethereum use ZK for confidentiality?
A: No. Ethereum is fully public, no built-in confidentiality.

Q: Where does Celestia fit in rollup ecosystem?
A: It acts as a data availability layer for rollups.

Q: How do DA layers and zk L2s differ?
A: ZK L2 = execution layer. DA layer = guarantees data availability so validators can reconstruct state.

Q: Why is data availability needed if we already have proofs on L1?
A: Without DA, validators can’t reconstruct state or check validity. Hashes alone are insufficient.

Q: Are optimistic rollups slow?
A: Yes, because challenge periods last ~1–2 weeks.

Q: What happens if fraud is detected in optimistic rollups?
A: Fraud proofs can revert transactions within the challenge window.

Q: Are L2s centralized compared to L1?
A: Yes, often. Most rely on a centralized sequencer.

Q: Can sequencers censor users or fail?
A: Yes. This has happened (e.g., Arbitrum outage). Escape hatches exist to submit directly to L1.

Q: Are decentralized sequencers coming?
A: Yes, many projects are working on them.

Q: What kinds of transactions can be batched in rollups?
A: All transaction types can be batched.

Q: Does L2 finalization depend on L1?
A: Yes. In zk rollups, finality is when the batch + proof is committed and finalized on L1.

Q: Why is the “zero-knowledge” part often ignored in rollups?
A: Rollups mostly use ZK for scalability, not privacy.

Q: In optimistic rollups, what’s the role of calldata and danksharding?
A: Calldata = stores state transition data. Danksharding reduces costs by making data availability more efficient.

Q: Does data availability affect L1 scalability?
A: Yes, DA requirements push L1s toward being “light chains” (focusing on proof verification, not full data).

Q: What about ZKML?
A: Inference or training steps can be proven correct without revealing sensitive model inputs or parameters. Covered later in course.

Q: If the verifier can compute H(x), is it still zero-knowledge?
A: Yes. Verifier only knows H(x) at specific points, so full polynomial reconstruction isn’t possible. ZK holds.
