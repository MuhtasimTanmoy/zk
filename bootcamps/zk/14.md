### Q&A on Vanishing Polynomials, MPC, ZK Proofs, and Related Topics

**Q: Can you give an overview of vanishing polynomials?**  
**A:** Vanishing polynomials are polynomials designed to evaluate to zero at specific points (e.g., roots of unity in a domain). In ZK proofs (e.g., STARKs, SNARKs), they enforce constraints, ensuring computations satisfy predefined rules. For example, in Mina, they help verify state transitions without revealing private data, used in recursive proofs to maintain constant proof size (~22kB).

**Q: Does secret sharing reveal one party’s secret to others?**  
**A:** No, secrets are split into shares; k parties must combine shares to reveal the secret.

**Q: Is secret sharing done by an aggregator?**  
**A:** Yes, combining shares (aggregation) reconstructs the secret; the program doing this can be called an aggregator.

**Q: Are links for papers updated?**  
**A:** Not specified; check lecture notes or resources provided.

**Q: What’s more secure and flexible, MPC or multisig?**  
**A:** MPC is more secure (distributed key generation/signing) and flexible (easier to add wallets).

**Q: Can MPC wallets hide party identities and private keys?**  
**A:** Private keys are hidden; identity privacy requires additional features.

**Q: Is r (random value) more than a specific large value?**  
**A:** Yes, r must be sufficiently random and large for security.

**Q: Is number transfer governed by Diffie-Hellman key exchange?**  
**A:** Sigma protocols don’t use Diffie-Hellman.

**Q: Can Sigma protocol replace signature verification, like Schnorr signatures?**  
**A:** Yes, Schnorr signatures are a Sigma protocol variant.

**Q: Can keys be used in proprietary code (e.g., trading firm’s profiting code) to prevent unauthorized use?**  
**A:** Yes, keys can lock code execution, preventing unauthorized use if copied.

**Q: Which company used proxy re-encryption?**  
**A:** NuCypher.

**Q: Links for privacy-preserving trading with proxy re-encryption?**  
**A:** No specific resources; use case validated as viable for proxy re-encryption.

**Q: Is transparent voting more about game theory (incentives) than cryptography?**  
**A:** Cryptography ensures security/transparency; game theory designs incentives to deter bribery.

**Q: How does MACI prevent collusion?**  
**A:** MACI uses zk-SNARKs and secret-shared encryption with random “salt” to obscure votes, preventing collusion. See [MACI docs](https://maci.pse.dev).

**Q: Can ZK proofs and game theory enable a whistleblower to post sensitive info safely, avoiding defamation, while exposing culprits?**  
**A:** Yes, ZK proofs can verify info without revealing the whistleblower; game theory incentivizes allies to act. No specific resources provided.

**Q: Can ZK prove NFT ownership for actions without revealing ID?**  
**A:** Yes, proof of ownership grants access without exposing identity.

**Q: Can Worldcoin’s ID scan data security via ZK be independently verified?**  
**A:** Yes, independent audits of ZK proofs are possible.

**Q: Can a system sell an NFT, with new owner gaining access via ZK proof, preventing double-spending?**  
**A:** Yes, using timestamped proofs or double-spending prevention mechanisms.

**Q: Can ZK prove LLM input/output without revealing data, treating LLM as a black box?**  
**A:** Yes, ZKPs verify input-output relationships, preserving confidentiality in sensitive applications.
