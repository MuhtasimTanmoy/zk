### Q&A on Bridges, Oracles, Mina, and Related Topics

**Q: Every bridge is glorified multisig?**  
**A:** Yes, bridges rely on multisig or validator sets for cross-chain transfers, often centralized.

**Q: Taking care of parents basic responsibility, not social good?**  
**A:** Taking care of own parents is duty; others' parents is social good.

**Q: Podcast link?**  
**A:** Not specified; search for Mina/Tellor podcasts on platforms like Spotify.

**Q: High-level design of oracles and bridges?**  
**A:** Oracles: Fetch off-chain data (e.g., prices), sign/verify, post to chain. Bridges: Lock assets on source chain, mint on target via validators/multisig/ZK proofs.

**Q: In enshrined bridge, validators responsible for off-chain data correctness?**  
**A:** Yes, validators attest to data/state, ensuring security.

**Q: Career options on Tellor site? Follow-up reads after whitepaper?**  
**A:** Check Tellor Discord/GitHub for jobs. Follow-ups: Chainlink whitepaper, Oracle security audits.

**Q: Why need signatures of 500+ signers for block as ZK proof on Ethereum (Tellor)?**  
**A:** Threshold signatures prove consensus on state/data, replacing full ZK for efficiency.

**Q: What kind of signatures mentioned?**  
**A:** BLS or ECDSA threshold signatures.

**Q: Problem in POS chain like multiple chains?**  
**A:** Fragmentation reduces liquidity/security; bridges/ZK help interoperability.

**Q: Mina as Layer0. How prove Ethereum block?**  
**A:** Mina's zkVM (e.g., Kimchi) verifies Ethereum state transitions via recursive proofs.

**Q: Are ZKML libraries ready for developers?**  
**A:** Yes, e.g., EZKL, Risc0 ZKML; production-ready for simple models.

**Q: Resources on ZKML side for Mina?**  
**A:** Mina docs on zkApps with ML; Risc0 integration for ZKML proofs.

**Q: Process of Kimchi proof generation in Mina wallet? Differ from traditional? Client-side proof? Proof of private key/info? Storage? SP1 conversion?**  
**A:** Kimchi generates client-side proofs for transactions (e.g., key ownership). Differs: ZK privacy. Stores keys locally/encrypted. SP1: Converts RISC-V to Mina-compatible proofs.

**Q: Reports on progress of Mina teams? Where find or name?**  
**A:** Mina Foundation reports; check GitHub/Mina docs for grants/progress updates.

**Q: How large is the team for these projects?**  
**A:** O1 Labs/Mina: ~50-100; varies by project.
