iExec (iex.ec) is a blockchain platform for decentralized confidential computing, using TEEs like Intel SGX for secure, privacy-preserving data processing. TEEs create hardware enclaves to encrypt memory during computation, protecting against OS/hypervisor access. SGX enables this via isolated "vaults" for code/data. Platform supports frameworks like Scone/Gramine for unmodified apps; V8 upgrade adds SGX2 for larger memory/faster execution. Google Drive file inaccessible; no content retrieved.
