### Q&A on Partially Homomorphic Encryption, Mina, and Related Topics

**Q: What is meant by partially homomorphic encryption?**  
**A:** Encryption schemes that allow certain operations (like addition or multiplication) to be performed on ciphertexts, but not both. For example, E(m1+m2) = E(m1) + E(m2) supports addition, but multiplication (E(m1*m2) ≠ E(m1) * E(m2)) is not supported.

**Q: Can you give an example where partially homomorphic encryption may be used for a zk app?**  
**A:** For privacy of computation, e.g., in a zk app on Mina for private voting, where votes (encrypted numbers) are added homomorphically to tally results without revealing individual votes.

**Q: Is the HTTPS request similar to Internet Computer Protocol?**  
**A:** These projects are not related, so I would say 'no'.

**Q: For storage, what happens when a storage provider node withdraws? Assuming we are keeping Merkle root on-chain, leaves off-chain?**  
**A:** The system relies on redundancy of other nodes or pinning mechanisms to maintain availability. Without these, the data could become unavailable, even though the Merkle root remains verifiable on-chain.

**Q: As we already have zk capabilities on Mina, is Protokit really required?**  
**A:** Protokit offers flexibility and modularity that Mina doesn’t, like concurrency.

**Q: So the prover uses the Actions and Reducer to eliminate the concurrency issues?**  
**A:** Yes, that is a way you can do that.

**Q: Where is the transactional data of Mina kept? What is the size of that? Upon adopting data availability (Celestia), Mina will only do the consensus part + proof?**  
**A:** It is kept on archival nodes. Size is in the GB range. Upon adopting a data availability layer like Celestia, Mina won’t need archival nodes, but that’s the primary change.

**Q: Will we discuss zkSync?**  
**A:** Yes, next week.
