### Q&A on ZKML, STARKs, SNARKs, Verkle Trees, and Related Topics

**Q: Can you provide an overview of ZKML and resources similar to STARKs?**  
**A:** Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML) uses ZK proofs to verify ML model outputs or training data integrity without revealing private inputs (e.g., weights, data). It combines ZKPs with ML for privacy-preserving applications like secure inference or fraud detection.  
- **How it Works**: Converts ML computations (e.g., neural network layers) into circuits, then generates ZK proofs (SNARKs/STARKs) to verify outputs.  
- **Applications**: Private healthcare analytics, secure financial modeling, confidential AI inference.

**Q: The project from last year’s ZK hackathon (mentioned by Laurence) has a link to number theory? What exactly?**  
**A:** Uses combinatorial methods, likely leveraging number theory for polynomial constructions or cryptographic primitives in ZK proofs.

**Q: What is zero-knowledge about oracles?**  
**A:** Proving statements about external data (e.g., price feeds) without revealing source details, ensuring privacy and integrity.

**Q: Is Deco based on TLS notary?**  
**A:** No, Deco uses ZK proofs for privacy-preserving data access, not TLS notarization.

**Q: Do all STARKs and SNARKs require circuits for arithmetization?**  
**A:** No, alternatives like Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR) exist.

**Q: Is AIR like R1CS? What is Plonkish? Why different representations?**  
**A:** AIR (used in STARKs) defines constraints algebraically, unlike R1CS (rank-1 constraint systems) used in SNARKs. Plonkish is a generalized arithmetization for PLONK, supporting custom gates. Different representations optimize for specific proof systems (e.g., scalability vs. proof size). See [Halo2 Arithmetization](https://zcash.github.io/halo2/concepts/arithmetization.html).

**Q: Is AIR similar to how FRI works in STARKs?**  
**A:** AIR defines computation constraints; FRI tests polynomial degrees. They complement each other in STARKs.

**Q: Does AI-enabled security (e.g., Zircuit) replace consensus?**  
**A:** No, Zircuit uses AI at the sequencer level to filter transactions, enhancing security, not replacing consensus.

**Q: Why don’t ZK projects use Verkle trees instead of Merkle trees? Huge engineering effort for upgrade?**  
**A:** Mina uses Verkle trees for compact blockchain representation. Upgrading to Verkle trees requires significant engineering (new commitment schemes, node updates) but reduces proof sizes. Challenges include compatibility and testing.

**Q: For Verkle trees, do we provide more data as proof since multiple sibling nodes?**  
**A:** No, Verkle trees use vector commitments, reducing proof size by proving sibling relations implicitly.

**Q: What are circuits (MPT, RAM, Bytecode)? Precompiled?**  
**A:** Circuits represent specific computations: MPT (Merkle Patricia Trie) for state, RAM for memory ops, Bytecode for EVM execution. Not precompiled; designed for ZK proof generation.

**Q: What is the size of typical lookup tables?**  
**A:** Can be large (MBs to GBs), depending on application (e.g., range checks, opcodes).

**Q: Are lookup tables for saving computation time with precomputed values? Cost too much storage?**  
**A:** Yes, they reduce computation by storing precomputed results. Storage cost is high but optimized via sparse tables or compression.

**Q: Does the full lookup table need to be in memory?**  
**A:** No, can be partially loaded or computed on-demand.

**Q: Info on GPU prover? Which computations parallelized? FFT usage (domain transformation)?**  
**A:** GPUs parallelize FFTs (time to frequency domain), polynomial arithmetic, matrix operations, and cryptography for faster proof generation.

**Q: What was the 2008 paper mentioned?**  
**A:** Likely [Gentry’s FHE paper](https://iacr.org/archive/tcc2008/49480001/49480001.pdf) on early ZK concepts.

**Q: Mina verifies recursively, right?**  
**A:** Yes, Mina uses recursive proofs for a ~22kB blockchain size.

**Q: Are folding schemes faster than STARKs, no initial setup? Why not common?**  
**A:** Faster, no trusted setup, but complex and new, limiting adoption.

**Q: Specific applications for folding schemes?**  
**A:** Efficient recursive proofs, e.g., incremental verifiable computation or lightweight blockchains.

**Q: Why 2^31 - 1 + 1 in field arithmetic?**  
**A:** 2^31 - 1 is a Mersenne prime; +1 simplifies field operations in small fields (e.g., Binus).
