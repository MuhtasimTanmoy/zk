### Q&A on Mina, VRF, ZK Proofs, and Related Topics

**Q: How does a VRF work?**  
**A :** A Verifiable Random Function works by generating a random output along with a proof that this output is correct. Given an input and a secret key, the VRF produces a unique random output and proof. Anyone can verify the output's correctness using the proof and the public key, ensuring randomness and integrity without revealing the secret key itself. It's secure and verifiable.

**Q: Is privacy an option in StarkNet or zkSync like it is in Mina? If not, is there a plan to add it?**  
**A :** StarkNet Layer 2 will stay as it is, that would be done with L3. Same with ZKSync.

**Q: Verifier knows value of H(x) only for a few points, so he can't compute the H(x). Why? If verifier does enough samples cant they do langrage interpolation?**  
**A :** Yes, but usually verifier knows by far to few points to do the interpolation.

**Q: What is field element?**  
**A :** It comes from math behind ZK, an idea from mathematics, but in cairo case field is 'felt' which is variable of maximum allowed size.

**Q: Is commitment basically hash of a value that the prover will propose at a later time? Like bidding price?**  
**A :** Yes.

**Q: How do I check if the nullifier exists? Do we keep all previous nullifiers in a set?**  
**A :** All of the nullifiers are put into a set so you can check.

**Q: Are nullifiers kept in smart contract storage? Isn't that costly?**  
**A :** It can be but it's needed to prevent double spending.

**Q: What problem would we face if we dont create a nullifier? Doesn't utxo already track unspent notes?**  
**A :** W/o nullfiers zCash would have double spending issue, it just wouldn't work, would be like an unlimited money printer.

**Q: How zcash uses SNARK? Which computation is offloaded to untrusted party here?**  
**A :** In Zcash, zk-SNARKs are used to ensure the integrity of shielded transactions while keeping the transaction data private. Both proving and verification if offloaded to `untrusted` party.

**Q: Does nullifier checking for confidentiality indicating an ever growing set as more and more transactions occur?**  
**A :** Yes.

**Q: Which one is good? UTXO or Ethereum account based? Which one should future designs follow?**  
**A :** There's different trade-offs UTXO is better for privacy and scalability, while account-based is simpler for smart contracts.

**Q: Can nullifiers be used with eth account based model? Or it is specific to UTXO?**  
**A :** Specific to UTXO.

**Q: Does that mean eth account based model can never have confidentiality?**  
**A :** No, it's still possible.

**Q: What is the structure of a real world nullifier? Like public key + txn_id + utxo_id hash or sign?**  
**A :** In zCash Note Commitment, spending key, Nullifier Derivation.

**Q: But if transaction is confidential how do I and everyone knows that I received 100 unit of token?**  
**A :** You can check your own balance. Everyone can't, this is the idea, unless you allow them.

**Q: Is solana EVM compatible? Does solana has UTXO model?**  
**A :** Solana is not EVM compatible (but there is an EVM sidechain - NEON EVM). Account model, not UTXO.

**Q: How the circuit looks like this simple noir program? Is there any visualizer or dump like assembly instructions?**  
**A :** You can see the circuit by exploring compiled noir code - R1CS. Debugging tools are under development.

**Q: What is the typical size of crs for trusted setup? What is the memory required for a simple program like addition compared to fibonacc comparison to bulletproof**  
**A :** In systems like Zcash, the CRS size can be around 1-10 MB. What do you exactly mean by 'memory'?

**Q: What are pros and cons of noir and cairo? Which one faster and succint?**  
**A :** The main difference is execution environment. Cairo is meant for Starknet, Noir for Aztec though it can be generalised.

**Q: So a full node on Mina is in GBs?**  
**A :** Extropy's full node is in the GB but also on AWS, not sure which region.

**Q: Is this like beacon chain on ethereum containing only hash chain?**  
**A :** No, it is not.

**Q: Can ML proofs be done in MINA?**  
**A :** We will talk about Mina use cases and also about ZKML later. But I would say: they can if you have such a usecase.

**Q: How does everyone calculate same random value to agree on a concensus that who will be the next block proposer based on stake?**  
**A :** Everyone\s value is different, they get combined to introduce randomness in validator selection.

**Q: Can such recursive proofs be generated for state transition in every blockchain?**  
**A :** I think so.

**Q: So it is easy to verify but hard to generate proof as the blockchain grows**  
**A:** (Implied yes, from context.)

**Q: So, if MINA mainnet eventually gets to say 50000 blocks, how will the reursive design affect time/ cost to finality**  
**A :** You always have to verify one proof which is max 22kB.

**Q: What if a tx is incorrect? how MINA reject it?**  
**A :** That is possible, depends where it is detected that tx is incorrect.

**Q: How does the MINA blockchain store state? and what is the size of the state compared to the proof for 22 kb**  
**A :** Full state is stored separately on archive nodes.

**Q: So the size is always the same 20k but computation is growing since you need to do recursions with all previous blocks?**  
**A :** Proof A-1 proves A-2,A-3,A-4...... so you only prove the latest.

**Q: But what is the 8 variable limit in MINA?**  
**A:** (Not answered in transcript.)

**Q: How long does it take to generate the proof for the new block? And what's the time between two consecutive blocks? thanks**  
**A:** (Not answered in transcript.)

**Q: So it is n and n-1 , that is used in the proof generation.**  
**A :** Yes.

**Q: Does this mean the issues that happened with tornado cash - does not happen with MINA ? , in other words on-chain can decide what to do with the proof onchain there are blockchain maxis that say everything would need to be done on-chain for the most censorship resistance and decentralization? Are there downsides?**  
**A:** (Not answered in transcript.)

**Q: So these on-chain proofs are different than the 22KB latest state change?**  
**A:** (Not answered in transcript.)

**Q: Is the verifier a vrf function?**  
**A:** (Not answered in transcript.)

**Q: So can we use any kind of zkp on Mina?**  
**A:** (Not answered in transcript.)

**Q: So with zk apps also, the 22K limit will remain so right?**  
**A:** (Not answered in transcript.)

**Q: As new blocks added why its size dont change? Is it just hashing the prev state with new and keeping the root?**  
**A :** This is due to recursive nature, it has nothing to do with hashing, there are ZKPs.

**Q: Will the proof also contain zkapp's states?**  
**A :** The ZK app state is a part of general blockchain state. the proofs prove that this state is correct.

**Q: Is there a concept of gas in MINA L1. how does it compare to ETH? predictable i guess.**  
**A :** Yes, there is gas on Mina, tx's usually cost a few cents, you can check on the explorer.

**Q: Can u touch upon the ZK or the private data component a bit more in detail.**  
**A:** 

**Q: What made them preferred typescript instead of Rust?**  
**A :** I think Mina was created before current expansion of Rust, I assume developer accessibility.

**Q: Is it possible to have a public blockchain (like Ethereum) and use ZK proofs just for state changes?**  
**A:**

**Q: If mina has validators based on stake who does the works related to MEV, Proposer Builder, Priority Gas Auctions type work is the work to compute application logic managed by the developer or is it distributed and handled by nodes in the network? do I need to run my node to run code**  
**A:** No, you submit a tx that contains update and a proof.

**Q: Is the offchain computation with possible privacy in Mina easier to implement compared to starknet and zksync?**  
**A:** 

**Q: Given the fees is so less, how does it relate to MEV?**  
**A :** It is easier to do MEV when fees are lower, less risk, lower profit margin possible so who is doing the compute and do they decide what they compute?

**Q: So every transaction does update --- has to read from onchain first - seed state?**  
**A :** Yes.

**Q: Once the proof is generated, are they stored somewhere? persistent , in addition to being used on-chain**  
**A :** They are part of the state.

**Q: For a new node to join on Mina does it only have to download the 22kb proof? If that is the case cant sybil attack can simulate many nodes?**  
**A :** To be a block producer you have to download the full state. please explain how it can be used for an attack?

**Q: Is this similar to the new block containing the hash of the previous block?**  
**A :** Yes.

**Q: Will we do a deep dive into Risc0?**  
**A (Moder):** We will cover risc0 , but at a higher level, if you want more , let me know.
