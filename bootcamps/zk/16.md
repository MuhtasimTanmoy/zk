### Q&A on ZK, MPC, Dark Pools, and Related Topics

**Q: Is ZK a subset of MPC?**  
**A:** ZK proves knowledge without interaction; MPC computes jointly with privacy. ZK can be used in MPC, but not strictly a subset.

**Q: What is a dark pool?**  
**A:** System where traders submit orders without knowing available liquidity.

**Q: What is a ZK coprocessor? Something precompiled?**  
**A:** Specialized off-chain unit for computations, submitting ZK proofs to blockchain. Similar to EVM precompiles but for scalability.

**Q: Can we talk about ZK on projects like Bitcoin OS and the possibility of Cardano integrating with Bitcoin via ZK?**  
**A:** Bitcoin OS uses ZK for Bitcoin L2s (e.g., bridges, rollups). Cardano could integrate via ZK bridges for cross-chain, but no official plans.

**Q: Is there a list of proving schemes invalidated by recent advancements? What are the top three expected to build the ZK backbone in future?**  
**A:** None invalidated. Top three: STARKs, PLONK variants, folding schemes (or mixtures).
