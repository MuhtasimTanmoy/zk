# ZK / Rollups / SSI — Q&A + Resources

## Q/A

**Q: Can we do a code walkthrough of a deployed decentralized sequencer, rollup, or proving scheme to map theory to implementation?**  
A: Yes — code walkthroughs of sequencers and proving schemes (Groth16, Plonky3, etc.) are valuable. Some will be covered later; session recordings or public repos can be used.

**Q: Can you give a code example how to create a proof for `age > 18` using addition and multiplication gates?**  
A: Yes — this is a standard tutorial example (compile to circuit, run trusted setup if needed, generate proof, verify). (See ZoKrates and bootcamp notes in Resources.)

**Q: Could we have daily assignments (papers / implementations on ZK, FHE, etc.)?**  
A: That’s a great pedagogical idea — daily reading + small implementable tasks accelerate learning.

**Q: Can we include SSI topics like AnonCreds and BBS+/BBS signatures?**  
A: Yes — SSI (AnonCreds, BBS+) is relevant and should be included (see identity foundation + Hyperledger anoncreds links in Resources).

**Q: What about Bulletproofs, Monero, FHE, TEE?**  
A: These are important topics. Monero and Bulletproofs will be covered; FHE and TEE are also relevant for privacy-preserving pipelines.

**Q: Can we have a side discussion (Discord/Slack) on different ZK companies and what problems they solve?**  
A: Yes — a side-channel (Discord) is helpful to compare company designs and focus areas across the ecosystem.

**Q: How could verifying a credit score work with ZK proofs?**  
A: Example approach: compute credit score off-chain, create a ZK proof that `score >= threshold` without revealing raw financial data. (See repo zkCreditScore in Resources.)

**Q: If SNARKs are efficient, why would StarkNet use STARKs?**  
A: Trade-offs: STARKs are transparent (no trusted setup) and quantum-resistant; they may have different prover/verifier time and proof sizes. Choice depends on trust model, cost, and performance targets.

**Q: How does L1↔StarkNet communication happen securely?**  
A: Via L1 contracts and sequencer infrastructure; only certain L1 contracts are accepted and sequencer whitelists are used to ensure trusted messages.

**Q: Can MEV happen with a sequencer?**  
A: Yes — sequencers can perform MEV; decentralization and sequencer design aim to mitigate this (escape hatches, decentralized sequencers, etc.).

**Q: In StarkNet, who is prover and who is verifier?**  
A: The L2 (StarkNet) proves execution; an Ethereum L1 contract acts as verifier for proofs. See StarkNet architecture docs.

**Q: If a function parameter is `i32`, can it be other types?**  
A: It depends on the language and program; the example used `i32`, but parameters can be other types if defined so.

**Q: What is `Some` in Rust?**  
A: `Some` is a variant of the built-in `Option` enum in Rust.

**Q: Will Rust be used to write prover logic?**  
A: You can write provers in many languages. Some provers (and tooling) are written in Rust; for Cairo you’ll write programs/contracts in Cairo and the prover may be in Rust.

**Q: Verifier knows values of `H(x)` for a few points — can't they do Lagrange interpolation?**  
A: In theory yes, but in protocols the verifier only gets far too few points to reconstruct the polynomial, so interpolation is infeasible.

**Q: How does calldata / danksharding fit with optimistic rollups?**  
A: Calldata stores state transition data; danksharding reduces data cost and improves DA efficiency — important for rollup throughput.

**Q: Can rollups exist without data availability layers?**  
A: Not safely. Without DA, validators can’t reconstruct state even if proofs are on L1. DA layers and L2s are complementary.

**Q: Why might rollups ignore ZK’s privacy properties?**  
A: Many rollups primarily use ZK tech for scalability (succinct verification) rather than privacy; privacy features can be added but are not always the focus.

**Q: Where to get help or homework answers?**  
A: Homework answers will be provided in due course (per course logistics).
