# Zero-Knowledge & Confidentiality — Q&A Notes

---

**Q: How do I check if the nullifier exists? Do we keep all previous nullifiers in a set?**  
A: All nullifiers are put into a set so you can check. In practice, they are often kept in a [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) for efficient membership checks.

---

**Q: Are nullifiers kept in smart contract storage? Isn’t that costly?**  
A: Yes, they are kept in contract storage. It is costly, but necessary to prevent double spending.

---

**Q: If only the spender can create a nullifier, how does the system know if a note already has one?**  
A: The system cannot proactively check. A nullifier is revealed when spending. Each transaction provides a nullifier, and the contract checks if it’s already in the set.

---

**Q: What happens if we don’t create nullifiers? Isn’t UTXO enough?**  
A: Without nullifiers, Zcash would have double-spending issues. It would effectively become an unlimited money printer.

---

**Q: How does Zcash use SNARKs? Which part is offloaded to untrusted parties?**  
A: Zcash uses [zk-SNARKs](https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/) to ensure shielded transaction integrity while keeping data private. Both proving and verification can be offloaded to untrusted parties.

---

**Q: Does nullifier checking imply an ever-growing set?**  
A: Yes. The nullifier set grows with every transaction.

---

**Q: Can you share a guide to understand Bulletproofs and inner products?**  
A: See [Cathie Yun’s talk on Bulletproofs](https://cathieyun.github.io/talks/2019-08-11-bulletproofs).

---

**Q: Can ring signatures be used for multisignatures?**  
A: No. Ring signatures provide anonymity by hiding who signed, while multisignatures require all participants to co-sign.

---

**Q: Why did Grin lose traction compared to Beam? Was there a hack?**  
A: No hack. Beam took a startup/investor approach, while Grin remained community-driven. See [Beam vs Grin overview](https://blockonomi.com/beam-coin-guide/).

---

**Q: Which model is better: UTXO or Ethereum’s account model?**  
A: Trade-offs:  
- UTXO → better for privacy and scalability.  
- Account-based → simpler for smart contracts.  

---

**Q: Can nullifiers be used in Ethereum’s account model?**  
A: No, nullifiers are specific to UTXO.  

---

**Q: Does that mean Ethereum’s account model can never have confidentiality?**  
A: Confidentiality is still possible through zk-proofs and rollups, even without nullifiers.

---

**Q: What is the structure of a real-world nullifier?**  
A: In Zcash: derived from Note Commitment + Spending Key (Nullifier Derivation).  

---

**Q: What are universal ZK circuits?**  
A: Proof systems that can handle any computation without requiring a new trusted setup each time.  

---

**Q: If a transaction is confidential, how does anyone know I received 100 tokens?**  
A: Only you can check your balance. Others can’t unless you explicitly reveal it.  

---

**Q: Can the verifier logic be used outside of blockchain?**  
A: Yes. Verifiers are just cryptographic checks — they can be used in non-blockchain systems.  

---

**Q: Is Solana EVM compatible? Does it use UTXO?**  
A: Solana is not EVM-compatible (though [NEON EVM](https://neonlabs.org/) exists as a sidechain). Solana uses an account-based model, not UTXO.  

---

**Q: Is there a visualizer for how Noir compiles into circuits?**  
A: You can inspect compiled Noir code as R1CS constraints. Debugging/visualizers are still under development.  

---

**Q: What’s the typical CRS size for trusted setups?**  
A: In systems like Zcash, around 1–10 MB.  

---

**Q: Which is better to learn — Noir or Cairo?**  
A: Either is fine. Cairo is StarkNet-specific, Noir is used in Aztec (but can be generalized).  

---

**Q: Why was Tornado Cash targeted, while Zcash and Monero also provide confidentiality?**  
A: Tornado Cash’s *smart contract itself* was sanctioned by the U.S. government — the first time in history a **piece of code** was sanctioned. This made it a unique legal target compared to asset-level privacy coins.
