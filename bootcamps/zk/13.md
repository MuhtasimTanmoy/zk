### Q&A on SNARKs, STARKs, PLONK, and ZK-Related Topics

**Q: Is SNARK based on hash functions and STARK on elliptic curves, or the other way around?**  
**A:** STARKs use hash functions (transparent, no trusted setup); SNARKs rely on elliptic curves (smaller proofs, trusted setup).

**Q: What intermediate representation does PLONK use? Is it SNARK? Which IOP + PCS IR uses?**  
**A:** PLONK is a SNARK. It uses arithmetization (e.g., R1CS or custom gates) as IR, with IOPs and polynomial commitment schemes (PCS) like KZG.

**Q: How does PLONK actually work?**  
**A:** PLONK converts computations to polynomials, uses permutation checks for constraints, and KZG for commitments. See [HackerNoon article](https://hackernoon.com/how-we-can-better-understand-plonk).

**Q: How to think about STARK vs. SNARK? When to use which?**  
**A:** STARKs for scalability, quantum resistance, no trusted setup (larger proofs). SNARKs for small proofs, fast verification (requires trusted setup).

**Q: What is an IOP?**  
**A:** Interactive Oracle Proof: Prover-verifier interaction with queries to polynomial oracles.

**Q: What functions can be converted to polynomials?**  
**A:** Any function mapping inputs to outputs (e.g., arithmetic operations).

**Q: What does "extend" to a large domain mean, and how does it help?**  
**A:** Extending polynomials to larger evaluation domains (e.g., roots of unity) enhances security in FRI by increasing points for low-degree checks.

**Q: Does 96769 have to be a prime number?**  
**A:** Yes, it’s a prime, often used in field arithmetic for ZK proofs.

**Q: Why is the boundary condition the 512th number? Does accuracy change if less?**  
**A:** 512 is an example; fewer points may reduce proof robustness but depends on setup.

**Q: How do you know there exists a function f where f(g²x) = f(gx) + f(x)?**  
**A:** Constraints define such f; derived from program logic in circuit design.

**Q: Why use generator value for numbers? What powers are they raised to?**  
**A:** Generators (e.g., roots of unity) define evaluation points (powers 1, 2, …) for polynomial interpolation.

**Q: Why is low-degree test needed?**  
**A:** Ensures polynomial degree matches expected computation, preventing cheating.

**Q: Are we interpolating polynomial f(x) using points (0,1), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)?**  
**A:** Yes, if those points represent the computation’s trace.

**Q: If g=2, does f(2²x) - f(2x) - f(x) = 0?**  
**A:** Yes, when g=2, it enforces the functional equation.

**Q: What is a vanishing polynomial?**  
**A:** Polynomial evaluating to zero at specific points (e.g., domain roots).

**Q: Has the course time changed?**  
**A:** UK time change; now 5PM GMT.

**Q: Where does FRI fit in STARKs?**  
**A:** FRI checks low-degree property of polynomials in STARKs.

**Q: What does FFT do in this context? Transform which domain?**  
**A:** FFT converts time domain (coefficients) to frequency domain (evaluations) for efficient polynomial operations.

**Q: Checking low-degree property means only checking polynomial degree? What if higher?**  
**A:** Yes; higher degree fails verification, indicating incorrect proof.

**Q: Can you attach papers in lecture notes?**  
**A:** Links provided where relevant.

**Q: Isn’t it like the sumcheck protocol?**  
**A:** Similar; sumcheck verifies polynomial sums, FRI checks degrees. See [sumcheck post](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/blogpost.pdf).

**Q: Looks like FFT protocol?**  
**A:** FRI uses FFT for polynomial evaluation, but focuses on degree testing.

**Q: What ZK skills for cryptographer vs. ZK dev jobs? Are STARK/PLONK papers key for cryptographers?**  
**A:** Cryptographer: Deep math (polynomials, fields, SNARK/STARK design). Dev: Circuit design, ZK languages (Cairo, Noir). Papers critical for cryptographers.

**Q: Chance at cryptographer roles without PhD?**  
**A:** Yes, with strong math, publications, or open-source contributions.

**Q: What do non-PhD cryptographers bring? To replicate?**  
**A:** Practical skills: coding ZK circuits, contributing to projects (e.g., zkSync). Study math (algebra, cryptography), build portfolio.

**Q: Poor at math, can I just learn ZK use cases?**  
**A:** Yes, focus on applying ZK libraries (e.g., Arkworks) for use cases like privacy apps.

**Q: Week 5 schedule? Must attend all calls?**  
**A:** Sponsor week; attendance required. Check with Encode for details.

**Q: Publish ZK paper without academia, CS background, industry job?**  
**A:** Contribute to [ZKProof community](https://community.zkproof.org), collaborate, submit to conferences.

**Q: Is secret sharing basis of threshold cryptography or MPC?**  
**A:** Both; enables secure key splitting and computation.

**Q: Which sponsors for Week 5?**  
**A:** Not specified; check with Encode.

**Q: Do QR codes, barcodes, credit cards use error-correcting codes?**  
**A:** Yes, checksums (not hashes) validate data; redundancy limits correction.
