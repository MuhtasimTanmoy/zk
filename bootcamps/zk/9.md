### Q&A on ZK-EVM, Mina, and Related Topics

**Q: What is an IR (Intermediate Representation)?**  
**A:** IR refers to a low-level representation of a program used internally by the Aleo compiler and virtual machine.

**Q: Do smart contracts live on both main chain and rollup chain (L2)?**  
**A:** Application smart contracts on L2s and L1s are independent.

**Q: Is SP1 a ZKVM?**  
**A:** Yes.

**Q: A knows number x, B knows number y. They want to know if x=y without revealing it. Can ZK-EVM be used for this? Example?**  
**A:** Yes, you can write a verifier in Solidity and run it on a ZK-EVM to prove x=y without revealing x or y.

**Q: Are transactions completely private in ZK-EVM?**  
**A:** No, unless the blockchain’s data availability layer is not public.

**Q: If someone ports a Solidity smart contract to a ZK-EVM, what are the competitive advantages vs. standard EVM?**  
**A:** Higher throughput, lower fees, and scalability benefits due to ZK scaling.

**Q: Can you give a brief proof for the x=y problem?**  
**A:** You would need to build such a proof in a ZK language, e.g., proving x-y=0 without revealing x or y.

**Q: Why would a Layer 1 contact Layer 2?**  
**A:** Not clear; typically, L1 verifies L2 proofs or facilitates asset transfers via bridges.

**Q: Does ZK-EVM use Solidity?**  
**A:** Yes, any language that compiles to EVM opcodes, including Solidity.

**Q: How is the Avail project different from ZK Rollups?**  
**A:** Avail focuses on data availability for blockchains, unlike ZK-Rollups, which focus on off-chain computation.

**Q: Is there private data in ZK Rollups?**  
**A:** Typically no, but it’s possible to make rollups private.

**Q: Does the sequencer run a transaction?**  
**A:** The sequencer coordinates and passes transaction execution to an executor.

**Q: Is circuit creation like a smart contract low-level language?**  
**A:** Similar, as circuit creation defines constraints and computations, like smart contract logic.

**Q: Can you give a sample example of a proof involving ZK-EVM?**  
**A:** ZK-EVM proves that EVM opcodes have been executed correctly, e.g., verifying a transaction’s state transition.

**Q: Can circuits in ZK-EVM be upgraded?**  
**A:** Yes, ZK-EVMs can have software updates, like any blockchain.

**Q: In summary, is the sequencer the coordinator, execution client generates trace, and prover network generates proof? Is ZKVM part of the prover network?**  
**A:** Yes, sequencer coordinates, execution client generates trace, prover network generates proof. ZKVM is typically part of the prover network.

**Q: Is ZK-EVM used to verify that a transaction was done properly in an L2? What’s the ZK aspect?**  
**A:** Yes, ZK-EVM verifies correct transaction execution on L2. ZK proves computation integrity; privacy is not typically used in rollups.

**Q: Can you give an example of a ZK-EVM circuit?**  
**A:** See [fluentlabs-xyz/zkevm-circuits](https://github.com/fluentlabs-xyz/zkevm-circuits) for circuit implementations.

**Q: For x>y, keeping x and y private, how is ZK used? What happens on L1 and L2?**  
**A:** ZK proves x>y without revealing x or y on L2. L2 generates the proof; L1 verifies it via a Solidity verifier contract.

**Q: In zkSync, is the verifier a smart contract on Layer 1?**  
**A:** Yes, the verifier is a smart contract on L1, ensuring L2 proof correctness.

**Q: Is it possible for Mina L1 to act like an L2 for Ethereum, with L2 data posted to Ethereum L1?**  
**A:** No, Mina’s setup doesn’t currently support this.

**Q: How does the Kakarot project provide compatibility from CairoVM to EVM?**  
**A:** Kakarot translates CairoVM programs to EVM-compatible opcodes. See [docs.kakarot.org](https://docs.kakarot.org/overview/solution).

**Q: Does CairoVM use the same stack-based approach as Ethereum?**  
**A:** No, CairoVM does not use a stack-based approach like Ethereum.

**Q: Will we discuss sharding in Ethereum?**  
**A:** (Not answered in transcript.)

**Q: Does ZK-EVM replace EVM runtime and execution client?**  
**A:** No, ZK-EVM extends EVM with ZK proof verification, not replacing runtime or clients.

**Q: Can we use MPC for the x>y problem to keep it private?**  
**A:** Yes, Multi-Party Computation (MPC) can be used to compare x>y privately.

**Q: Is a bridge used to transfer funds between ZK-EVM and EVM? Is it controlled by someone?**  
**A:** Yes, bridges transfer funds. They can be centralized (with an owner/multisig) or decentralized (ownership renounced).

**Q: What is meant by modular?**  
**A:** Distinct, independent components that interact flexibly and customizably.

**Q: What is Layer 3?**  
**A:** A network built on top of L2, e.g., Madera on StarkNet, for specialized use cases like app chains, offering scalability and customization.

**Q: Are L3s similar to parachains on Polkadot?**  
**A:** Similar but not identical. See [Polkadot Parachains](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains).

**Q: Does ZK-EVM’s EVM compatibility mean more functionality (opcodes)?**  
**A:** Yes, ZK-EVM supports EVM opcodes, often with enhanced scalability.
