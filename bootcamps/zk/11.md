### Q&A on Mina, Risc0, ZK Proofs, and Related Topics

**Q: In Mina, can you run a block producer in a browser?**  
**A:** Yes, Mina’s lightweight design allows block producers to run in a browser.

**Q: In Risc0, is the binary the program that gets run on a server?**  
**A (Fox Reymann):** Yes, in zkVM, production apps typically run on a server.

**Q: The dependency `risc0-zkvm = { path = "../../risc0/zkvm" }` in the Risc0 project folder doesn't exist. How to fix?**  
**A (Fox Reymann):** Install `risc0-zkvm` with Cargo and use the Cargo-installed version.

**Q: Does Alice need to trust Bob's zkVM to input her password? How can Alice trust Bob's zkVM? Via source code?**  
**A (Fox Reymann):** The password stays in Alice’s environment. She can verify the zkVM source code for trust.

**Q: What is a co-processor?**  
**A (Fox):** Performs complex off-chain computations. Axiom’s ZK co-processor enables data-rich, intensive Ethereum apps with blockchain security.

**Q: Can Axiom be used to build something like The Graph on Ethereum?**  
**A (Fox):** Yes, for ZK-verified blockchain events/data.

**Q: Will we have access to bootcamp notes after the course ends for future reference?**  
**A (e):** Yes, notes remain accessible post-bootcamp.

**Q: Will course content for Encode’s EVM Bootcamp be shared?**  
**A (e):** You must participate in the EVM Bootcamp to access its content.

**Q: Is each data point being proved in ZK its own polynomial in theory?**  
**A (Fox):** No.

**Q: If two different polynomials are evaluated at close points (e.g., 1,2,3,4), are they more likely to be equal or unequal?**  
**A (Fox):** Unequal.

**Q: If someone samples enough points, why can’t they figure out the polynomial? For Lagrange, only d+1 points are needed, right?**  
**A (Fox):** Yes, but polynomials in ZK proofs are high-degree, making it impractical to sample enough points.

**Q: Can the verifier ask for the degree of the polynomial? What determines the polynomial used? Is it arbitrary?**  
**A:** The polynomial is determined by the computation/function being proved, not arbitrary. Verifiers typically don’t ask for the degree directly.
